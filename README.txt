Description
-----------
Programmed in R language to detect anomalies in data sets. We utilised the PCA method to
determine which variables are appropriate for anomaly detection in electricity consumption.
Furthermore, we trained and tested Hidden Markove Models to determine the degree of anomaly
in the data sets with anomalies. 

For the techincal part of this project, A.C worked on PCA, cleaning up, and preparing and
testing for datasets for model building. Prince worked on model training and testing, as well 
as applying the model to detect anomalies.
